# Text Similarity and Modeling
A poorly-maintained document similarity and topic modeling script. Allows one to use HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) worksets, or simply collections of .txt documents to compare with a target document also in .txt format.

## Steps
From the command line, run `text_sim_model.py` _is_HTRC_ _file_locs_.
